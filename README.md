# Impressionism-Brush-Strokes
Computational Art: Lab 6 (Implicit equations)

In this lab, I used implicit equations to determine the boundries of where color strokes start and stop.

As you can probably tell, the strokes are made from many ellipses of varying color in most parts of the piece.
The implicit lines allow for defined edges of regions where you want a specific color and for shaping what you want.
The strokes follow imaginary guidelines in order to take the shapes that they have.

Within this repository, you will find a screenshot of the final product attached. Enjoy!
